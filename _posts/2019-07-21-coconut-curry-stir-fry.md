# Coconut Curry Stir Fry

Makes 4-5 servings. Takes an 50 minutes to prepare, which is about the duration of rice cooking.

## Equipment

- Frying pan with a lid
- Rice maker
- Knife
- Cutting board
- Can opener
- Grater

## Ingredients

- 1 cup of brown rice
- 1 onion
- 4-6 cloves of garlic
- 2 lb of assorted vegetables (ex: carrots, peas, string beans, cauliflower, broccoli, squash etc.)
- 8 oz can/box of full fat coconut milk
- 3 tbsp of curry paste
- 1 in finger of ginger
- 1.5 tbsp of coconut oil
- Salt, to taste

## Instructions

### Make rice

1. 45 minutes before you eat, start the rice maker (1 cup of brown rice requires 2 cups of water)

### Prep vegetables

1. Wash vegetables
1. Cut, trim, get to manageable and edible size any vegetables
1. Keep vegetables separate
1. Grate ginger

### Stir fry vegetables

_You may need to add more oil throughout these steps if things get dry or stick to the pan._

1. Add frying pan to stove top range at medium heat
1. Melt coconut oil in frying pan, spread on bottom
1. Add onions to frying pan, cook for 3-4 minutes or until fragrant.
1. Add garlic, ginger, and a sprinkle of salt to frying pan and cook for 3-4 minutes
1. From here, cook remaining vegetables in order of what needs the most time to cook. Cook the physically hardest ones first and progress to the last one as they get softer 
    - Example: Add carrots before peas. 
    - This is contingent on how you cut them. A thin cut squash will be softer than a pepper, but not if cut into thick pieces.
    - Caveat: Any vegetable that is better steamed should **NOT** be added yet. Examples are broccoli, cauliflower, and peas.
1. Add thai curry paste to frying pan and stir in.
