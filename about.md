My name is [Jeff](http://twitter.com/plusjeff) and I'm a crappy cook. 

However, I'm getting better with help from friends, family, and the Internet. As a cooking beginner, I have trouble following unspecific instructions like "toss a glug in there, and add this until it comes to taste." While I'm grateful to my community for the help, much of it comes in a non-linear, non-explicit, or too long-winded form -- which my brain has trouble with.

This blog is simply some recipes that I've translated for myself and written down so that I can understand and reliably repeat them. The primary goal is to have a record for myself, but if I'm writing it down, might as well share with y'all!
