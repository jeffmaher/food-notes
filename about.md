Hey everyone! My name is [Jeff](http://jeffmaher.me). I'm a software developer (read: I make computer programs for a living), but I also am super interested in a bunch of things:

- Making the world a better place (think: limiting climate change, making government better, etc.)
- Outdoors (especially hiking, biking, and running)
- Wellness and health
- Food (yum)

I like learning new things and writing them down (so that I remember). Fortunately, writing things down also makes them super easy to share. This site is my way of sharing, even if the topics covered are scattered.
